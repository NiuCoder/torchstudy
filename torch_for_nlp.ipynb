It is a model that tries to predict words given the context of a few words before and a few words after the target word. This is distinct from language modeling, since CBOW is not sequential and does not have to be probabilistic. Typcially, CBOW is used to quickly train word embeddings, and these embeddings are used to initialize the embeddings of some more complicated model. Usually, this is referred to as pretraining embeddings. It almost always helps performance a couple of percent."

    "At this point, we have seen various feed-forward networks. That is, there is **no state maintained** by the network at all.<br>\n",
    "**Sequence models are central to NLP: they are models where there is some sort of dependence through time between your inputs.** The classical example of a sequence model is the Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech tagging. Another example is the contional random field.<br>\n",
    "A recurrent neural network is a network that maintains some kind of state. For example, its output could be used as part of the next input, so that information can propogate along as the network passes over the sequence. In the case of an LSTM, for each element in the sequence, there is a corresponding hidden state $h_{t}$, which in principle can contain information from arbitrary points earlier in the sequence. We can use the hidden state to predict words in a language model, part-of-speech tags, and a myriad of other things."
